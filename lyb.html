<p>I like to play badminton, because badminton is a whole body sport. Not only can exercise the flexibility of the body, 
but also can make physical and mental health development.
 Badminton needs two people together to carry on, can cultivate the spirit of the group, can also enhance friendship. 
 If you are weak and sick, you can also try to strengthen your body with badminton. Doing more exercise is really a good thing to say. 
 I think doing sports is not necessarily to do a lot of, as long as their physical fitness, in line with their own personality. 
 I am most interested in badminton. Badminton fascinates me because every time I play badminton, I throw myself into it. 
 Even if I fall to bleed or hurt, I ignore it. Whenever I have time, I must go downstairs to the park to practice constantly, 
 in order to make progress. Think back to the past when I first learned badminton, really nothing. The feeling at that time made me give up.
  Fortunately, a group of friends encouraged me to deepen my understanding of badminton. One hard, one harvest. I understand this very well, 
  as long as willing to work hard, believe that they will be able to do. Badminton is the same reason, we must have more training, 
  do not wait for the advent of the word lucky. As long as you set your goals, you can do it.</p>
